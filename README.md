# Bone up on undergrad CS algorithms and data structures

An assortment of algorthms and data structures implemented from text books and Algomoster, probably Leetcode and Project Euler as well.

Just a parking spot for code.

The code found here is written on MacOS, but for the most part there is no reason why it will not run on Linux s or Windows.
